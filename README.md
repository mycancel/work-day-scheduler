## Description

The Work Day Scheduler was created with [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [Bootstrap v4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/). Moment.js was used to display the current day on the top of the page as well as format the text boxes according to the past, present, and future CSS classes. Bootstrap was used to format the table's rows and columns. When text is entered in the text areas, they can be saved to local storage by clicking its corresponding save button.
